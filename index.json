[{"content":"Hello, world. Starting a new blog today!\nWhy blog?  I already publish a bunch of stuff on my Facebook profile, and wished that my posts get a home of their own. I feel like it. I had an unsuccessful Wordpress blog in 2007-2008, and want to try to make it better this time.  What blog? I plan on posting:\n Math stuff. Programming \u0026amp; technology stuff. Projects and stuff. Stuff I\u0026rsquo;ll copy from my past posts on Facebook.  Arbitrarily, some posts will be in English, and some in Hebrew.\nHow blog? For this blog, I chose Hugo. The reason I chose Hugo is that that\u0026rsquo;s what Shay Nehmad is using. ðŸ¤·\nI\u0026rsquo;ll write more about it in my next post({{/\u0026lt; relref \u0026ldquo;how-to-build-this-blog.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;/}}).\n","description":"Hello, world.
